# Arduino-Robotic-Prosthetic

# Hey! I'm looking for help in creating a semi-afforfable robotic Prosthetic.

I'm new to coding, but have several ideas I'd like to try out 

This first one is an Arduino based Robotic Prosthetic, that could be controlled via signals from the brain.

Though I know these exist to some degree I've thought of another way for them to potentially be made.

I wondered if a team on here would have the knowledge in both coding and components to make this idea possible?

First step - Create both a robotic arm (with full human range), and a separate arm that when attached to a real arm will output that persons movements to the robotic arm exactly. 
Second step - using an openbci brain-computer-interface, focus the sensors on the parts of the brain responsible for arm movement, and  map the signal output from the open bci, to the input signal of the arm input
Third step - remove the need for the arm controller, so that the openbci is the true output to the robotic arm 

As I've said I'm very new to all of this, and im sure theres more steps, that I've got some terminology wrong, or maybe that it may not be possible
But just wondered if it was, and if anyone wanted to pursue this idea with me?
